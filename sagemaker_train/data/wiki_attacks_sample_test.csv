"` 2005 (UTC) ::::Of course atheism is a religion: it attempts to answer all the big questions that other religions do, and is based on a metaphysical claim incapable of empirical proof.  But you can quibble about what ``religion`` means all you want, because the fact remains that theistic religions and atheism are all worldviews.  ::::Many evolutionists disagree that evolution has nothing to do with atheism.  E.g. Dawkins said that Darwmin made it possible to be an intellectually fulfilled atheist, and Provine claimed that a religion was compatible with evolution only if it was for all practical purposes indistinguishable from atheism.   ::::Communism is predicated upon atheism. 09:52, 30 Mar`",0

"`Text from parallel article Anthony Ashley Cooper, 9th Earl of Shaftesbury, reformatted to wrap properly but with typos intact. This reads like an old article from The Children's Encyclopedia, but I don't know if that's where it came from:   Piccadilly Circus is the centre of London where many streets meet. In the middle of the Piccadilly there is a small island of stone, and on the island there is a statue called Eros. Eros holds a bow and arrow, and leans forward as if he is flying over London.On the steps below him women used to sit with baskets of violets and snowdrops, or bunches of pink carnations and tight little rosebuds.  All around are buses and lorries, and taxis and cars coming from north and south and east and west.Day and night the busy London traffic swirls round the small, stone island, and day after day people hurry past on their way to shops and theatres and staions and offices.  Everyone knowws Eros. Taxi drivers look up at him and say,  ``Ah,Eros!Here we are at Piccadilly!``  CHildren, holding tightly to their mothers' hands as they cross the road, try to catch a gimpse of him between the rows of traffic. But no one seems to have time to go up the steps, and read the words that are written below the statue. Many people, though they know Eros so well, don't know at all why he is there.  He is there to remind them opf a story about a man called the Earl of Shaftesbury, who spent his hole life heping children.`",0

"` ::Yes, I agree wholeheartedly with that. I'm from Amsterdam, The Netherlands, myself. I've been in France and other European countries back in the disco era, and what we call ``disco`` is encompassing much more than what is being made of it here. For instance, loads of really good disco music was made in Italy, Germany, France and even here in The Netherlands, because there was a lot of money in mafia to buy the early synthesizers. Moroder, for one, was an Italian living in Munich when the Donna Summer hits were created I believe. Disco to us here therefore also includes music by Gino Soccio, Cowley, Moroder himself (not only his Donna Summer work) plus many Italian producers. When I see this page, it's as if Europe didn't influence the genre, while it is the other way around in many ways. It wasn't Chicago or London where house-music started, even, the first fast-paced housey acidy music came from Italy, Germany and The Netherlands if you ask me. Take for example 'Remember' by Vivien Vee from 1977, and 'Crazy Family' by Jock Hattle, the long version from 1982. They both have long-lasting breaks in them, perfect examples of disco that would now be called ``house`` or maybe even ``trance`` for parts of them.`",0

If you have any doubts, then check the discussion page for that article.      It wasn't long ago that all references to ``Keith Wigdor`` were removed from this ``surrealism`` article. This removal occured because of Wigdor's total unimportance to the surrealist movement, for the simple reason that Keith Wigdor is, at best, an emerging digital artist who fancies himself as a being a surrealist, and who has many times attempted to pose as a surrealist. Needless to say, many of the english-speaking surrealist groups listed on this page know about him and refuse to have anything to do with him. Keith Wigdor appears again and again to disrupt all things genuinely surrealist.     It is also interesting to note, if you check the discussion archives of this ``surrealism`` article, that these same 2 users were also involved with promoting Keith Wigdor as a surrealist, in this very article.

"   == The source of legislative authority == The opening sentence is wrong. It says In the politics of the United Kingdom, legislative authority (that is, the power to make laws) is vested in Parliament . . .   Incorrect. Legislative authority is vested in The Queen-in-Parliament, ie the participation of the monarch and the two houses. Unless the Queen Assents to a Bill, it cannot become law. In fact no monarch since Queen Anne with a Militia Bill in I think 1714 has declined to grant Assent. But Assent is still a legal requirement. Legislature authority exists only through The Queen-in-Parliament. Executive authority only exists through The Queen-in-Council with the cabinet exercising executive  power as a committee of the (Privy) Council. (That's why every minister must be a Rt.

"  == Some personal observations here: == Put a summary of it into the Roots of Christianity; perhaps a whole subsection thereof.  If the Zoroastrianism part is included, then so must the Egyptian especially since the Hebrews were long associated with Egypt back to the Hyksos invasion.  It would be POV to disclude this factor, considering the trail of monotheism left by Akhenaten and adopted by the Hebrews.  I myself don't know much about Zoroaster, but I certainly recognise much of the Egyptian issue and I'm more of a casual researcher.  It seems to me that Zoroastrian elements are tied to the Persian background, but it would be prejudiced to say that the Egyptians have no basis when they long dominated Palestine.  The Greek Pharaoh himself patroned the Septuagint in Alexandria.  I find the bigotry towards an Egyptian root of Christianity to be entirely unfounded when so much of Egyptian culture was adopted by all peoples in a certain radius outwards.  Perhaps this lies in traditional ideas about race; that the Hamites of Africa have not contributed anything and that the Persians supposedly were/are White or considered Japhethic as opposed to the Semites.  Seriously, this Noahidic classification thing is ridiculous because these Afro-Asiatic people are undoubtedly very much alike and most uninvolved observers would say they are less White than the Greeks and Romans.  I consider Persians to be Semites because they are Asian, in this context.  Give it as much credence as the Persian foundations and you will make this NPOV.  I seriously suggest expounding upon both roots of Christianity and also delineating the Greek root which provided Roman impetus for adoption and proliferation.  For instance, if the Greeks hadn't patroned that religious culture as their relation to Philistines, Rome would have dismissed it as everything else in their cultural relationship with Greece.  Rome even rebuilt Greek Philistia as Palestine and during the Catholic Crusades, it became the Kingdom of Jerusalem.  Christianity has so many dimensions, that it would be haughty to overlook its far ranging origins which even has pagan influences from Europe and Buddhist ties in Southwest Asia.    I myself used to be atheist or Odinist not wanting to deal with what I percieved to be other peoples' culture and now I look in wonder at the historical background of the Sea Peoples and the subsequent Graeco-Roman expansion in the Mediterranean Sea.  There are European roots throughout the region now considered Islamic or Arab, but if we don't provide the means for people to see it we will forget it as much as the terrible destruction of the Library of Alexandria.  Just think of the term Indo-European and you will understand Alexander the Great's empire.  See the connection between the European fylfot and Indian swastika or the Cross and the Ankh?  Please don't demolish this magnificent research, for it has been a great boon in my life to know these things.  I am only stating things as I commonly have studied and heard of them.  I do not propose to limit and debar other positions on this issue, therefore I am not endorsing POV.  The various sources I have seen via Google search appear legitimate and/or sometimes biased(as anything!), but it is not my position to judge the appropriateness of the topic.  We are not to cast a POV on the issue in favour or against, just to deliver as any messenger does.  The existing article on the History of Christianity provides the Persian background but does not give adequate coverage of the Egyptian or Hellenic origins, which are quite prominent.  After all, Christianity had most of its evolution in non-Persian areas of the Mediterranean Sea.  Tell me, how many Persian people are prominent in the Christian world throughout its history?  What fractionary comparison can you draw that factually examines the amount and shows a majority of Persian elements in Christianity, compared to the vast amount of Greek specialty(as written, verified and generally known amongst the entire Christian populace) and the nursery of Christianity itself in Egypt via the Old Testament(even Jesus's infancy was spent in Egypt, in safety from Herod!)?  Please, where is the background of Christianity in Persia besides 19th century racial studies?  Like I've said, the Noahide classification thing has been similarly discredited and its density in weight grew most during that era for Indo-Aryan racist theories.   ",0

"`  Ok, I retract my claim about British men's feet above!

Apparantly, before the foot was standardised people used three different lengths: * a foot of 13 inches made from two shaftments of 6.5 inches each, * a foot equal to 12 inches, * a ``natural foot``, Latin: pes naturalis, of about 9.8 inches   has these tidbits about the measure: * the traditional Danish foot, equal to about 12.365 inches or 31.41 centimeters. * early civilizations of the Middle East had a longer foot, roughly 30 centimeters  * a Greek foot is at about 30.8 centimeters (12.1 inches) * a Roman foot at 29.6 centimeters (11.7 inches) * Swedish fot aka the Stockholm foot, equal to 11.689 inches or 29.69 centimeters * German fuss came in several versions: ** Viennese fuss was 12.444 inches (31.608 cm), ** Rheinfuss (Rhine foot) was 12.357 inches (31.387 cm) ** Bavarian fuß was 29 cm (11.41 inches) * French pied had several lengths, the best known being the royal foot (pied de roi) of 32.48 cm * Italian pie varied, 29.8 cm was one common length, but Venice used 34.8 cm and Bologna 38 cm * Spanish pie was the traditional foot of Spain and: ** in Spain was about 27.86 cm (10.97 in) ** in Argentine was 28.89 cm (11.37 in) ** in Texas was 11 1/9 inches or 28.22 cm  Finally, in 1869 Benjamin Gould measured the feet of the Chinese Terracotta Army, and found the average foot length was 25.6 cm without shoes (10.07 inches) and 27.7 cm with shoes (10.9 inches) - |  22:42, 2004 Sep 27 (UTC)`",0

"`   ==Changes, subtle errors == Oleg, I am concerned about the edits that you are making.  My first impression is that it is much harder to understand than it used to be.  It used to be precise as to what it meant; much of that precision has been removed. The result is the sublte introduction of errors...   in part by removing that precision.  For example, the ring over tau_p is not isomorphic to the ring x^n^p which is what you seem to be implying; the degrees of polynomials are totatlly different: if P(tau) is a polynomial, then  n^(deg P(tau)) = deg P(x) one is kind-of-like the exp/ad of the other, sort-of.  And you cut out the paragraphs that made this distinction: tau a is not equal to a tau, but tau a is equal to a^p tau ...  The ring is never commutative when the field is not F_p ...   The field is called F_p not Z/pZ dammit. We already talked about this before. Nobody but you calls it that.  Stating that aP(x) is also additive is important, I don't see why you cut that out.   k{tau} is not k[x] e.g the next theorem to mention is that for any p(x) in k[x] there exists a g(tau) in k{tau} such that f(x) divides g(x).  These g(tau)'s are a left ideal in k{tau}  Using language like ``its quite easy to prove`` and ``it follows quickly`` and ``it can be shown that`` is, at best, filler, and, at worst, misleading as to the actual difficulty of the theorems you are alluding to.

"`=== Removed Personal Nerd Fluff ===  Kibo is the nickname, username and e-mail address (kibo@world.std.com or kibo@kibo.com) of James Parry (b. July 13 1967), a Usenetter known for his sense of humor, various surrealist net pranks, an absurdly long .signature, and an uncanny, machine-assisted knack for joining any thread in which his nom de guerre is mentioned (to ``kiboze``). His exploits have gleaned him a multitude of enthusiasts, who celebrate him as the head deity of the joke pseudo-religion kibology, centered on the newsgroup alt.religion.kibology.   James Parry grew up and lived in Schenectady, New York before moving to Boston, Massachusetts about 1990, where he lives today. He initially was a Computer Engineering major at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute (RPI) in Troy, NY, but when he moved to Boston attended Emerson College, where he studied videography and graphic design.  At that time, he also worked as a typeface designer and for the world.std.com internet service provider, whose praises he sings on his website (in a rare moment where he is not being outrageously tongue-in-cheek).  He has a great artistic eye for typeface and developed several fonts in use today.  Many assume his nickname is derived from the acronym KIBO, although Parry himself has repeatedly denied this.  Another rumor has it being short for King Body, a pseudonym he very briefly used on computer forums as a freshman at RPI in the mid-1980's.  Kibo is a supertaster, and has prosopagnosia.  He frequently dyes his hair, which as of late 2004 is bright orange.  Kibo likes bacon, but greatly dislikes cheese.  == External link == *Kibo's website  `",0

I've tried to clarify this. ``Folk rock`` is used very specifically and is typically far more recognised by instrumentation than form. Many folk musicians of the 60s (Tom Paxton, Phil Ochs etc) sang new, topical material (which distinguished them from traditional folk musicians) but in the folk idiom (acoustic instruments, traditional arrangements and often traditional melodies.)  Re: the comment about ``marketers`` in the first paragraph. If language reflects common usage, what is now called ``folk music`` has as much right to the name as any other form. Gareth Owen  To the latter: fair enough, but does the first paragraph actually imply otherwise? LMS  I like the page in general but wonder if the following is unnecessarily cynical (implying, as it does, a financial rather than artistic incentive to change musical styles): :``Some of these performers, of which Joan Baez is an excellent example, began their commercial music careers performing traditional music in a traditional idiom, but soon transformed their style and accompaniment to suit popular tastes.``  Ya know, I agree, but I don't know how to change it right off. Anyone else want to give it a stab? LMS  The deletions are merely of things that seemed redundant. Additions may solve the problem of tone mentioned above.

PLO vs. right-wing Jews?  ===How to work together===  I think we can get started on the article, even if we can't yet agree on where the article should go, and what we should call the ``sides``. But if the name of one side becomes a stumbling block, I don't know what to do. Buff, you're not going to insist that the POV you outlined on Friday (and which led me to hope for a peaceful Sabbath -) is the Palestinian side, are you?

First of all if we did not allow POV in external links we'd have to remove half the external links in Wikipedia. Secondly, all film reviews are, by definition, POV (I don't know of any reviews that don't express an opinion) so we'd have to remove all links to film reviews if NPOV applied to external links. We don't remove links simply because of the politics of the site linked to. I think you also misunderstand the concept of ``vandalism``. We can't simply throw around the term to justify removal of any material we don't like. It applies specifically to activity that disrupts wikipedia or disrupts an article. I've seen MIM reviews quoted in Harper's so they are actually relatively well known if only for their amusement value. There is no reason why we shouldn't have external links to Christian film reviews or Marxist film reviews. A broad variety of links is encouraged. What's discouraged are repetitive links to similar material (eg reviews from a dozen daily newspapers would be repetitive).   As to your point about ideology, I don't know if you've ever studied film theory in university or read academic journals on film such as cahiers des cinema but serious film criticism does actually deal with ideology, subtext etc and is not just the ``thumbs up`` ``thumbs down`` type review you see in a newspaper. By your argument we couldn't link to serious scholarly articles on films, many of which ``deconstruct`` films from a Marxist, feminist, postmodern, or other ideological perspective. For instance, Susan Sontag's important and influential writings on film would be banned, by your argument, as they are ideological in nature and explore the subtext of films rather than simply being a technical critique.   Hope this clarifies things.    ::Specifically to Curps, while I agree that linking to hundreds of mainstream reviews would be repetitive I see no problem with listing to a variety of reviews from different mainstream and non-mainstream viewpoints. Whether or not a review is listed on ``Rotten Tomatoes`` is not really relevent as that site really only deals with popular mainstream reviews. Indeed, by your criteria we could not link to serious scholarly critiques of films carried in scholarly journals. We do not determine the worthiness of links by how mainstream or popular they are.
